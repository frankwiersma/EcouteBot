# Telegram Bot Project

This project implements a Telegram bot using Python. The bot likely has audio processing capabilities, as it uses the Deepgram API.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies (you may want to use a virtual environment)
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
```

4. Replace `your_telegram_bot_token_here` and `your_deepgram_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

## Configuration

The project uses a `config.py` file to load environment variables:

```python:config.py
startLine: 1
endLine: 7
```

This configuration file loads the environment variables from the `.env` file and makes them available for use in the project.

## Dependencies

The project uses several dependencies, including:

- python-dotenv (for loading environment variables)
- telegram (for the Telegram Bot API)
- deepgram (for audio processing)

A full list of dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file (not provided in the given code snippets).

## Usage

To run the bot, execute the main Python script (not provided in the given code snippets).

## Features

The exact features of the bot are not clear from the provided code snippets. However, given the use of Deepgram API, it's likely that the bot has some audio processing or speech-to-text capabilities.
